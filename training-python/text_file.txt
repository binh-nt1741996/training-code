At least 12 people have been shot dead by a Thai soldier in and around the city of Nakhon Ratchasima (also known as Korat), police say.

A defence ministry spokesman told BBC Thai that Jakraphanth Thomma, a junior officer, attacked his boss before stealing a gun and ammunition from a military camp.

He then opened fire at a Buddhist temple and a shopping centre in the city, which is north-east of Bangkok, he added.

The suspect is still at large.

Posts on social media appear to show the scene of a shooting near the shopping centre.
